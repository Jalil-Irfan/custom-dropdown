# custom-dropdown
Creates a customized dropdown which helps to select values from dropdown and also to enter a custom value by the user. Inputs can be restricted based on the input types too.

I am a UI developer who is more into performance and design tweaks.
This is my trial and very first open source add-on. I am a amature in ember and addon creations.
Hope it helps you guys any suggestions on code compatibility, improvments, simplicity is very much welcomed.
